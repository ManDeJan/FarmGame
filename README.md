# Generic FarmGame

Hi, this was my submission for the third [Vagabond Dog](http://www.vagabonddog.com/)
gamejam. The theme was "a year", you can check the other submissions out here:
https://www.vagabonddog.com/blog/game-jam-a-year This was my first experience
with Godot, gamedev and creating my own assets. I like to share these
experiences, therefore I decided to share my project. The code was made under
pressure, so I'm sure you'll find some funky bits. But you should be able to
import it into godot and poke around with stuff.
